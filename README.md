# Name That Bird!

A webapp for learning to identify birds.

Right now this is limited to North American species, but hopefull others will be added in the future

## Current Features
* Different difficulties (1-5)

## Forthcoming Features
* Cache photos on the server side
* Use geotagging data to figure out where/when image was taken, and use that as a hint
* "Birds near you": Filter by birds seen in a selected area (supposing the eBird API still works)
* Let users type in their answers and earn points
* Perhaps some more fine-grained difficulty settings on the easier end of the spectrum

## Maybe if I feel like it features
* Source from other sites (does 500px have an API? Google image search? etc)
* Let users mark images as unclear/wrongly marked/blurry/etc
* Filter by genus, group ("warblers"), etc
* Include non-ABA North American birds

## Pull Requests Welcome

If there's a feature you'd like to add, I'd love to see it!

Ping me via IRC (flowerhack on freenode) or email (julia@flowerhack.com) if you have any questions, or just open the PR and I'll take a look.

Thanks to the New River Birding and Nature Festival in 2014. A group of us played an IRL version of this game
during my time there, and I liked it so much I wanted to make this app.
